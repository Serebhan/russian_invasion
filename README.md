# russian_invasion
Attack of Russian bombers, the Millennium Falcon under the flag of Ukraine confronts them. Try to win!

"Alien_invasion" is include main class and it is file for run game.

What to add to the project:

- Sounds, they are already there and collected in the sounds folder. Others can be suggested

- For each difficulty level, add not only bombers, but also tanks and the ship "Moskva" - their images are in the folder with images. I see it so the next screen update after the victory of the Millennium Falcon should consist of new heroes (alternately - planes, ships, tanks and so on)

- You also need to update the menu, make it clearer, perhaps add a start button, add animation for pressing buttons.

- It is also necessary to add support for running programs on faster processors. We assume that this may be due to the high probability of finding out the user's processor, dividing it by my frequency, where the game is running normally and thus leveling the frequencies in the screen refresh rates.
